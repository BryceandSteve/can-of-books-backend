### Cooperative

- Make a list of each parson’s strengths.
  - Bryce: Strong in javascript, staying on top of assignements, and working together with my team to get stuff done.
  - Steve: Strong in CSS and design web layout, graphic design, research, teamwork, work overtime, and dedication.

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application?
  - With both of us strong in different areas, and ability to work together, we should have a solid lay out of what needs to happen, and how to tackle each individual situation.

- In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength?
  - Steve: I want to develop better JS apps.
  - Bryce: I need to develop a greater strenght in CSS and design web layout.

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development?
  - open line of communication.

### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - We will talk to each other like adults and figure it out.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - We can talk to each other, if that fails, we can get sara or jb involved.

- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We will again talk to each like adults, and explain things that confuse one another.
